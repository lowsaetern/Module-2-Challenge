# Module-2-Challenge: Portfolio
In this weeks challenge we were tasked with creating our very own portfolio from scratch. This is a basic portfolio that showcases some information about me, a couple of projects I have deployed and my contact information.
<br>
<br>
Since this was our first time creating a website from scratch I used everything I have learned so far in this program.
<br>
Using html I was able to input the content for my portfolio and with CSS I was then able to style it. Implenting features such as flexbox and mediaqueries etc, I was able to create a user friendly/responsive layout.
<br>
<br>
I was able to put in two live pages in my work section where when clicked, it would take you to the deployed applications of Run-Buddy and Horiseon. The other two images in my work section will serve as placeholders as I go through this course I will be able to update them with deployed applications.
<br>
<br>
Below I have attached a screenshot of my portfolio as well as a link to it as well.
